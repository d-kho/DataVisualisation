# Data Visualisation


During my coursework I've had the opportunity to learn about data visualisation methods (in particular network visualisation). This repository contains past data visualisation work. 

Both the GoT and MCU datasets are based on past Graph Drawing Competition (2018 and 2019 respectively). Data cleaning was conducted with R. Variations of different visualisation methods or layouts were applied, some were created in R and others were made using Gephi.
